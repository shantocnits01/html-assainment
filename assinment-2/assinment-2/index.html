<p style="color:green">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of <strong>the printing </strong>and<b> typesetting </b>industry.<br>
 Lorem<i>  Ipsum has been the industry's  </i>standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
 when an <em>unknown printer took a galley</em> of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset<br>
 sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br>
 Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
