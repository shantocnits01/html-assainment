<p style="color:green;text-align:justify;margin-top:-20px">Microsoft Office, or simply Office, is a family of client software, server software,<br>
 and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988,<br>
 at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity<br>
 applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft<br>
 PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features<br>
 such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting<br> 
 language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software <br>
 under the Office Business Applications brand. On July 10, 2012, Softpedia reported that Office was<br>
 being used by over a billion people worldwide.[12]</p>
